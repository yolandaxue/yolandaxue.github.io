In this set of research projects, I use textual analysis to measure innovation, examine the economic importance of innovation, and explore the application of textual analysis in innovation and management research.

## Working Paper

A text-based analysis of innovation disclosure<br/>

<ul>In this paper, I develop a novel text-based measure of innovation disclosure using the financial documents of all publicly listed firms in the United States from 2007 to 2017. This text-based measure of innovation disclosure describes the disclosed information of the whole innovation process that is voluntarily disclosed by firms, including early-stage R&D inputs, innovation throughputs (such as patents and trademarks), and innovation outcomes. This paper also examines the factors that impact the corporate innovation disclosure strategy. </ul><br/>

<ul>Keywords: innovation, patent, R&D, disclosure, textual analysis</ul>
