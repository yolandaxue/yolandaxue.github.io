I developed my interest in teaching since my first undergraduate teaching assistant experience with the first course in the sequence of the Intermediate Microeconomics. I was chosen as the peer tutor in the following semester to help develop and experiment the Peer Tutoring Lab at UCSD Department of Economics. Due to the high level of student engagement in our experiment, this tutroing lab succesfully transited into a funded long-term program to help all the undergraduates in Economics with intermediate level courses.

## PSET Tutor (Apr. 2016 - Mar. 2017)
* Mentored hundreds of students from the intermediate microeconomics course sequence to understand class materials, learn how to apply economic models to solve problems, and prepares for exams.

## Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (Jan. 2016 - Mar. 2016)
* Assisted in teaching Intermediate Microeconomics A, drafted exam questions, and led discussion sections.
* Was chosen as one of the peer tutors and helped the department to successfully experiment the Peer Tutoring Lab, which later turned into a long-term program funded by the university.
