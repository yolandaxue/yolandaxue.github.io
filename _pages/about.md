Welcome to my website! My name is Yolanda Xue. I am an applied economist by training and an experienced researcher with solid modeling, data analytics, and programming skills in STATA, Python, R, and MATLAB. Starting in June 2022, I will join [Uber](https://www.uber.com/) as an applied scientist. 

I have earned my Ph.D. (with M.S. awarded) in Applied Economics and Management from the [Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics & Management](https://dyson.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University and my B.S. in Joint Mathematics-Economics at the University of California, San Diego. <br/>

In my research, I apply causal inference, machine learning, and textual analysis techniques to quantify innovation disclosure using text data and examine what impacts innovation disclosure at the firm and market level. My research interests include:
* innovation
* information disclosure
* intellectual property rights
* digitization 

This website was initially designed for my job market. From now on, I will use this website to write blog posts. So you can expect a collection of posts on getting a job in Tech as an Econ PhD, machine learning for causal inference, and application of textual analysis in research.
